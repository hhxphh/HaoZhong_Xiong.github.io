I am a second-year master's student at the Image Information Engineering Laboratory, [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My primary research focuses on 4D Gaussian reconstruction and dynamic drivable digital human avatar modeling.
